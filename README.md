# Orloj Registry [app.orloj.xyz](app.orloj.xyz)

> *Orloj* (Czech for "astronomical clock") — a nod to Prague's iconic timepiece, built for **ETHPrague Hackathon 2026** and continued at **ETHGlobal Lisbon 2026**.

Orloj is a registry that exposes smart-contract interfaces to AI agents as **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**. MCPs are generated dynamically from [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/)-verified contract metadata, and signing is delegated to a **pluggable KMS layer** — pick **1Claw** (HSM + TEE) or **SpaceComputer Orbitport** (orbital HSM + SpaceTEE) per vault. Each registered contract is served as its own MCP endpoint by a single hot-pluggable registry process, gated by per-agent bearer tokens — agents never touch keys, RPCs, or gas.

## Highlights

- **Sourcify ABI → typed MCP server, dynamically generated.** Every function in a verified contract becomes an MCP tool with Solidity types parsed by alloy's `JsonAbi` and encoded/decoded at runtime via `DynSolValue` (tuples, dynamic + fixed-size arrays, all integer widths, `bytesN`), proxy ABIs resolved automatically via Sourcify's `proxyResolution` field. Zero per-contract integration: the moment a contract is verified on Sourcify, it is callable by an agent.
- **Hardware-rooted, pluggable KMS — keys never leave the enclave.** Each vault picks its signing backend: SpaceComputer Orbitport (orbital HSM + SpaceTEE; signing happens entirely inside the enclave on a 32-byte digest, with both `ETHEREUM` and `TRANSIT` schemes used in the same product surface for wallet signing *and* envelope-encrypted secret storage) or 1Claw (HSM + TEE intent signing). Both backends are wired into the same `signTransaction` path, so the agent surface is identical regardless of where the key lives.
- **Agents never hold a key, never see a transaction.** The registry constructs every EIP-1559 tx with viem, hashes it, asks the chosen KMS to sign the digest, reassembles `(r, s, yParity)`, and broadcasts. A compromised registry host cannot forge transactions — it can only request signatures it is already authorized to request, on a digest, against a key it does not hold.
- **Per-agent bearer tokens with grant-based authorization.** Each agent has a `mcpk_live_*` token (constant-time-checked against Postgres) and a per-vault grant carrying `permissions`, optional `secret_path_pattern`, and optional `expires_at`. The registry resolves the active grant on every MCP call and routes the signature to the matching KMS key. Revocation is a row update; keys never move.
- **Private personal agents, spawned on demand and wired straight into the Orloj MCPs.** Opening a chat spawns that user's own **ZeroClaw** process with an isolated config dir and workspace. At spawn time the agent's selected MCPs are connected to the agent. Inference runs on **0G Compute** through the 0G router using the **`qwen3.7-max`** model.
- **Immutable curated skills marketplace on 0G Storage.** The curated agent skills in [packages/skills-marketplace/](packages/skills-marketplace/) are published to **0G Storage** and addressed by their Merkle root hash, with the upload registered on 0G Chain. Orloj agents load them **dynamically**: pick a skill from the marketplace and it is fetched by root hash into that agent's workspace, teaching a running personal agent a new capability without redeploying anything.
- **Direct agent access to the Uniswap API — swap, quote, and manage liquidity.** An extra special MCP at gives the agent multichain `quote` and `swap` functionality over the **Uniswap API** on any registered chain, plus **Uniswap V3** liquidity management over the Uniswap Liquidity API.
- **Graph-powered LP manager — live subgraph data turned into liquidity decisions.** An internal `orloj-lp-manager` MCP ([packages/lp-agent/](packages/lp-agent/)) discovers the agent's own Uniswap V3 positions, queries the **Uniswap V3 subgraph on The Graph** for live pool, fee, and volume data, extracts deterministic range/activity features, and produces a strictly cited **HOLD / REDUCE_LIQUIDITY / REBALANCE** decision with a full audit trace.

## The Problem It Solves

AI agents today can read about smart contracts, but can't *safely* use them. To call a contract, an agent has to:

- manage private keys,
- pick an RPC and handle network failures,
- estimate and pay gas,
- understand each contract's ABI and quirks.

Every one of those is a footgun — and a reason teams don't ship agentic on-chain workflows.

Orloj removes the entire surface. Each contract is published as an MCP server, so the agent sees only **typed, verified interfaces** it can call like any other tool. Account management, signing, and gas are abstracted away by the registry layer; the agent never holds a key and never sees a transaction. The result: agents that can act on-chain with the same ergonomics as calling a REST API.

## Why This Matters for Agents

By abstracting key management and gas handling into the MCP boundary:

- **Simplified mental model.** Agents never need context about blockchain infrastructure, private key custody, or transaction mechanics — only contract interfaces. This shrinks cognitive load and reduces reasoning errors.
- **Infrastructure-agnostic.** Key rotation, HSM policies, network selection, and gas strategies are handled outside the agent's control loop. The agent stays focused on *what to do*, not *how to pay for it*.
- **Lower model requirements.** Even less powerful models (that support tool calling) can reliably execute on-chain operations. The agent doesn't need to reason about gas prices, nonce management, or transaction finality — it just calls a tool with clear inputs/outputs.
- **Higher reliability.** By removing accounts and signing from the agent's purview, you eliminate an entire class of bugs: fund loss, key leakage, stuck transactions, failed estimates. The registry layer enforces correctness.
- **Focused reasoning.** Agents can concentrate entirely on business logic — when to call what function and with what parameters — rather than worrying about the infrastructure layer.

## How It Works

Orloj rests on two pillars:

**1. Sourcify-driven MCP generation.** We use the Sourcify verified-contracts dataset as our source of truth for ABIs. The registry fetches a contract's metadata, parses its ABI, and **dynamically builds an MCP server** where every contract function becomes an MCP tool — with typed inputs, descriptions, and structured outputs. No hand-written wrappers; the moment a contract is verified on Sourcify, it's callable by an agent.

**2. Pluggable KMS-backed vaults.** Each vault holds a wallet whose private key never leaves a hardened enclave. At creation time the user picks the KMS provider:

- **1Claw** — HSM + TEE, intent-based signing. The agent issues a 1Claw *intent* and 1Claw signs inside the TEE.
- **SpaceComputer Orbitport** — secp256k1 keys provisioned inside orbital HSMs with **SpaceTEE**, "physically isolated, tamper-proof by any administrator or state actor." The registry constructs the unsigned tx, sends only the digest to Orbitport, assembles `(r,s,v)` into a broadcast-ready transaction, and submits it via RPC. Secrets stored alongside the wallet are protected by a per-vault TRANSIT (AES-256-GCM) key inside the same HSM (envelope encryption — ciphertext lives in our DB, the key never leaves the enclave).

The provider is recorded per vault, so a single deployment can run both side-by-side. The agent surface stays the same regardless of backend: "describe what you want done."

> SpaceComputer's Orbitport KMS is documented as experimental ("not for production"). Use Sepolia / testnets for the SpaceComputer-backed flows during the demo.

## Challenges We Ran Into

*(Placeholder — to be filled in towards the end of the project.)*

## Technologies Used

**Registry server** ([packages/registry/](packages/registry/))

- Rust (Cargo — not a pnpm workspace member)
- axum 0.7 — HTTP server
- [rmcp 0.16](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) — MCP protocol, Streamable HTTP transport
- alloy 2.0 — ABI parsing (`JsonAbi`), calldata encoding/decoding (`DynSolValue`), EIP-1559 tx construction
- sqlx 0.8 — async Postgres; per-agent bearer tokens (`mcpk_live_*`) verified with constant-time comparison

**Frontend / control plane** ([packages/app/](packages/app/))

- Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript
- Better-Auth with magic-link (Resend) + SIWE, ENS lookups via viem
- Postgres (vault ownership, agent ownership, MCP API keys, Orbitport vault metadata + envelope-encrypted secrets)

**Agent runtime** ([packages/zeroclaw-agents/](packages/zeroclaw-agents/))

- ZeroClaw — one private agent process per user, spawned over ACP from a template `config.toml` into an isolated per-agent config dir + workspace
- [0G Compute](https://0g.ai/) — decentralized inference for those agents: model `qwen3.7-max` via the 0G router (`https://router-api.0g.ai/v1`)

**On-chain & infra**

- [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/) — verified contract metadata / ABIs (source of truth for MCP generation)
- [1Claw](https://1claw.xyz/) — key vaults, intent-based signing, HSM-backed keys, TEE signing
- [SpaceComputer Orbitport](https://docs.spacecomputer.io/) — orbital HSM-backed KMS (`@spacecomputer-io/orbitport-sdk-ts`) for secp256k1 signing keys + AES-256-GCM envelope-encryption keys
- [0G Storage](https://0g.ai/) — immutable hosting for the curated skills marketplace ([packages/skills-marketplace/](packages/skills-marketplace/)): skill bundles are uploaded to 0G Storage, addressed by Merkle root hash with the upload registered on 0G Chain, and fetched + hash-verified at runtime into an agent's workspace
- viem — local tx construction, digest hashing, signature recovery, broadcasting

**Tooling**

- Claude Code — development
- Claude Design — UI/design exploration

## Run It Locally

The registry reads `.env`; the app reads `.env.local`. Copy the examples and fill in secrets before starting:

```bash
# from repo root
cp packages/registry/.env.example packages/registry/.env
cp packages/app/.env.example      packages/app/.env.local
```

Fill in at least:

- **`packages/registry/.env`** — `DATABASE_URL` (same Postgres as the app), and either `ONECLAW_API_KEY` + `ONECLAW_BASE_URL` or `ORBITPORT_CLIENT_ID` + `ORBITPORT_CLIENT_SECRET` depending on which vault provider you'll sign with.
- **`packages/app/.env.local`** — `DATABASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:3000`), `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` for magic-link sign-in, `REGISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3001` so the app can proxy to the registry, plus the same KMS credentials. Optional: `ETH_RPC_URL`, `ETH_RPC_URL_SEPOLIA`, `ENS_CHAIN`.

Then run:

```bash
# registry server (http://localhost:3001) — from packages/registry/
cargo run

# frontend (http://localhost:3000) — from repo root or packages/app/
pnpm install   # app only; registry is Rust/Cargo
pnpm --filter app dev
```

Node 24.15.0 and pnpm 10.33.2 are pinned via `.npmrc` and `packageManager` — `pnpm install` will refuse on the wrong versions (applies to the app only).
